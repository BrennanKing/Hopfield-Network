Building and training a Hopfield network to store images from the MNIST dataset.
Hopfield networks are a specific type of PDP model designed for autoassociative learning.

The purpose of this assignment is three-fold:

1) To get you familiar with a classic neural network model that is very different from most of
the models we get exposed to in machine learning nowadays, so that you donâ€™t fall prey to
the idea that neural networks are all deep convolutional networks.

2) To force you to think about the actual learning algorithm for a neural network and how to
implement that in code in an elegant manner.

3) To have you engage in some more in depth thought about auto-associative learning and
the relationship between auto-associative learning and brains.
